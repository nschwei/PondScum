## TODO
- basic movement [x]
- spinning in air [x]
       This is kinda jank right now and Im not sure what I want to do to make it better. Should I add something to reverse the spin direction
- Scoring points for spinning [] (keep it super simple for now + bonus for landing upright)
- score win limit []

### How should scoring work?
every time you complete a single rotation it should add a number of points to the counter
if you land an your feet you get a full score
if you don't you get a penalty multiplier
