## TODO
- basic movement [x]
- spinning in air [x]
       This is kinda jank right now and Im not sure what I want to do to make it better. Should I add something to reverse the spin direction (I did but I still don't really like what I did)
- Scoring points for spinning [x] (keep it super simple for now + bonus for landing upright)
- Add jump and land deformation [x]
- rag dolling in air [x]

- score win limit [x]
- drop shadow [x]
- limits change?
- dialogue system [x] (Just some short lines of text being said in the beginning?)
- lock/unlock mouse [x]
- height multiplier []
- spin boost pickup []
- SFX []
     - jump sound []
     - land sound []
     - full rotation ding (honk?)[]
     - pickup sound []
     - bounce sound []

### How should scoring work?
every time you complete a single rotation it should add a number of points to the counter
if you land on your feet you get a full score
